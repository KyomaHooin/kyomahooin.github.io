**  Blood and Guts in High School
     Her influence is similar to that of Burroughs and Moorcock, but

     ``The child of a government program to promot `wisdomm' becomes an
     electronic chameleon in his attempt to lose himself in a computer-
     controlled society.''
               - Chris Pepper
     1975

     Plagued by unemployment, a right-wing moral movement, inflation, and

Burroughs, William S.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**  Cities of the Red Night
**  Interzone
**  Naked Lunch
     ``A blast of maniacal laughter from Hell.  A combinations of comedy
     as black as clotted blood, Dr Benway's twisted medical speculations,
     tales of the criminal underground, and sexual fantasies that tear at
     your inseams like a rabid brontosaurus, all told in a fragmented
     prose style that still reads like the raw, beautiful poetry it is.''

     Collection.
**  Synners
     ``A long, detailed look at a cyberpunk L.A.  AI's, Virtual reality,
     viruses, drug enhancements, megacorps... the usual.  Multiple plot-
     lines trace several major and minor characters' lives while describ-
     ing the future in great detail.  An interesting way to pass the
     time, but a bit bogged down in itself.''

     to the styles of present-day cyberpunk writers.
**  The Simple Art of Murder
     Essay.
     ``When reading it, replace `mystery novel' with `sci-fi novel' and
     its amazing.  Every complaint the Cyberpunk authors had about

     stories.' ''

DeLint, Charles
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**  Svaha
     ``It has all the elements of contemporary Cyberpunk except for VR-
     type `Net' (some would argue that his mystical `Dreametime' scenes
     fill the role fo the Net nicely).  If you are familiar with the
     Cyeberpunk-based role-playing game Shadowrun then you will find much

**  Flow my Tears the Policeman said
     A Television host, who is supposedly a genetically superior human
     (manufactured) wakes up to find himself unknown.  In a grimy future
     world, with the aid of various drugs, a police general, and strange

     ``A novel, with nominal elements of archetypal characters -- the
     physcist, the cyberneticist, the theologist, the pilot -- who jour-
     ney to another star to meet a race of ETs call the Quintans.  More
     pessimistic thought on SETIs that's hugely entertaining, and the
     only decent description of interstellar travel *ever* written that's
     not ``lets's jump into hyperspace'' and not a thinly-veiled Ph.D.

**  Emerald Eyes
     Biogenetically engineered in a post-superpower world controlled by
     the UN Peace Keeping Forces, an extended family of telepaths fight
     for their personal freedom.
**  The Last Dancer
     Taken from the PR Release:
     Set principally in 2076, though there is a lengthy section set
     50,000 years in the past.  The book is principally about Denice
     Castanavers, during a TriCentennial Rebellion.  Trent is in the book
     for about one hundred pages.

     ``The last Dancer'' expands the stage on which events are taking
     place; you'll finally learn something substantial about the Continu-
     ing Time at large, as opposed to learning only about post-
     Unification Earth.

     May not see release until Mid-1993
**  The Long Run
     Seven years after the United Nations Peace-Keeping-Forces nuked the
     telepaths developed from the Superman Project, Trent the Uncatchable
     bumps into Denice.  What follows is their attempt to evade the PKF
     who stumbled upon the two.  Trent, using his skills, humiliates the
     PKF in the Earth-Moon system in an attempt to teach them a lesson.
