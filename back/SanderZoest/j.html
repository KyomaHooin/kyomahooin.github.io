<dt>o Dr. Adder (1972)
<dt>o Death Arms (1987)
<dd>     The son of a famous assassin is dragged and coerced into finishing
     his dead father's long unfinished business. Not cyberpunk.
<dt>o Farewell Horizontal
<dd>     Ask and Receive is the main information services provider on an
     artificial satellite orbiting the earth that has a way of always
     coming out on top in any transaction.  A graphic arts designer seeks
     new clients and discovers a few dark secrets the omni-potent corpo-
     ration rather he didn't know.
<dt>o Infernal Devices
<dd>     The son of a master clock worker deals with his departed father's

     post-Victorian England.
<dt>o The Glass Hammer   
<dd>     Shipments of illegal computer chips from the robotically controlled
     labs of silicon valley in a post-nuclear world are the backdrop for
     this story.  Meanwhile, the control of South American workers is
     made easier as they are drawn to the networks coverage of the action
     filled runs which include offensive SDI satellites seeking the cars
     and drivers but never quite hitting them.
<dt>o Madlands (1991)
